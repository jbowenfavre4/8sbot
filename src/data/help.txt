8sBot is a discord bot created by diz to record the results of MW3 custom 8's games. 

Commands
/register - Each player that wishes to participate will need to use this command once in the server to register before they can be added to any matches.

/recordmatch - adds a match to the record. The command sender must provide a gamemode, map, the winners, the losers, their KDOs (Kills/Deaths/Objective score) and the score. When entering the winners and losers, you will select the user based on their discord username (NOT display name) from a list. If the player has not registered, they will not appear in the list. You can start typing their username and the list will filter based on what you have typed. 

KDOs must be entered in the following format: K/D/O

Example: "24/21/75"

Objective score: 
    For Hardpoint, objective score is hill time in seconds. For example: 1:16 hill time would be entered as 76 (1:16 = 76 seconds)
    For SnD, objective score is number of plants.
    For Control, objectve score is number of captures. 

/general - displays overall stats based on all recorded matches. 

/help - displays this message. 


More commands with more specific statistics options will be added in the future.
